    <h2> This section I will try use the class function</h2>
    
    <div class="first-div">
    <p class="orange-paragraph">I don't really know what the tutor is on about but i'm trying to follow his instructions on how to use "class"</p>
    <p class="orange-paragraph">In the previous paragraph, I suceesfully used the "class" elements thing and named the class "orange-paragraph" in my code and it worked. Now for this paragraph, I will try copy and paste that same class code thing in Main.css and see if it works on this paragraph also.</p>
    </div>

    <H6 id="heading000">KA PAI IT WORKED!!!</H6>
    <p>I've also used the "div" with a class functions applied to change the font of the previous two paragraphs. In using the "div" thingy, I did't have to apply two seperate "class" thingies two each of the paragraph sections. This is because the "div" function thing divides the sections up. i.e., it grouped the two paragraphs together and applied the one calss to both within that "div". In addition, I just used the "id" function to change the font of the heading above. Thats where you start the code in the CSS file with a #, the div and class functions start with a "." in CSS</p>
